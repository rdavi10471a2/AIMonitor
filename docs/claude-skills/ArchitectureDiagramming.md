# Architecture Diagramming

Use this card when Claude needs to turn ambiguous architecture, workflow, validation, indexing, MCP/tool, or agent behavior into a clear diagram.

Prefer ASCII timelines first. Use Mermaid or another format only when the target doc already uses it or the operator asks.

## First Move

If prose is slippery, force it onto these axes:

- **Time:** what happens first, next, last.
- **Actor:** operator, Claude, MCP adapter, shared service, compiler, database, UI.
- **Artifact:** watched source, Working candidate, staged record, overlay, index row, source map, build output.
- **Gate:** hash check, validation, launch, human review, build, index refresh, policy decision.
- **Authority:** advisory, predictive, authoritative, durable, review evidence.
- **Failure path:** noisy, rejected, stale, abandoned, forced, replan.

If two ideas sound similar, put them in different boxes and label the difference directly.

## Use The MCP Surface

Before drawing AIMonitor behavior, use MCP evidence where available:

```text
get_tool_manifest
get_monitor_status
get_workflow_status
get_current_task_context
get_solution_index_status
get_solution_index_tree
query_solution_index
find_indexed_symbols
find_indexed_references
find_indexed_callers
find_indexed_relationships
get_source_map
list_session_staged_records
get_staged_record
compare_file
get_staging_guide
```

Use tool descriptions as the live contract for argument names. Do not infer MCP behavior from CLI command names.

## Freshness Check

Before diagramming a repo with active branches or review docs, separate evidence by freshness:

- **Implemented:** current code path or tests prove it.
- **Published contract:** docs on the requested branch say it, but code may lag.
- **Branch/proposal:** review notes, diagrams, PR docs, or findings describe intended behavior.
- **Inference:** reasoned from source shape but not directly proven.

Label the diagram or key with the evidence class. If docs and code disagree, diagram the disagreement instead of smoothing it over.

## Default Timeline Shape

```text
PLAN     declare intent / scope
           |
EDIT     create candidate artifacts
           |
GATE 1   predictive check
           |
REVIEW   human/tool review boundary
           |
GATE 2   authoritative confirmation
           |
STATE    durable result / follow-up
```

After the diagram, add a short key explaining what the diagram proves.

## Good Diagram Labels

- `semantic overlay compile`
- `HASH-ONLY integrity check`
- `full build on real watched tree`
- `Working candidate`
- `staged immutable record`
- `operator saves watched source here`
- `index refresh closure`
- `source-map evidence`

Avoid mushy labels such as `validation`, `refresh`, `sync`, `process`, or `finalize` unless the next sentence defines them.

## Portable Host Vocabulary

Keep behavior host-neutral first:

```text
stage immutable review evidence
launch human diff review
record accepted/rejected decision with staged hash
```

Then add host names only when needed:

```text
MCP: stage_candidate_for_review -> launch_staged_diff -> record_diff_decision
CLI: edit stage -> edit launch-diff -> edit record-decision
```

Do not mix MCP and CLI names inside ordinary operator steps.

## AIMonitor Example

```text
PLAN     start_monitor_session(filesPlanned=[A,B,C])
           |
EDIT     refresh/new + create Working candidates A', B', C'
           |
GATE 1   semantic overlay compile
         watched tree + A' + B' + C'
         predictive; may be noisy for Razor/generated artifacts
           |
STAGE    stage_candidate_for_review(A,B,C)
           |
REVIEW   launch_staged_diff
         operator merges staged bytes in WinMerge
           |
DECIDE   record_diff_decision
         watched source changes here on accepted save
           |
GATE 2   full build on real watched tree
         authoritative confirmation
           |
INDEX    rebuild affected index rows
```

Key read:

- GATE 1 predicts whether the planned overlay should work.
- GATE 2 confirms what actually landed.
- If GATE 1 and GATE 2 disagree, the question is fidelity, placement, or merge drift.
- The point where watched source mutates must be visible in the diagram.
